## What I Learned
1. I learned how to initialize a new Vite project and configure it for React development.
2. I created a Header component, structured it within the app, and applied basic styling.
3. I practiced setting up a Git repository, committing changes, and pushing them to a remote GitHub repository.

## Components Structure
1. BlogPost: Individual blog post display
2. BlogList: Container for multiple posts
3. Header: Navigation and site title

## Styling Approach
I used regular CSS styling the components to ensure clean, reusable styles and a maintainable structure.

## New Features
1. Added BlogPost and BlogList components to display individual posts and a list of posts.
2. Integrated sample data to populate the blog posts dynamically.
3. Applied responsive design for mobile and desktop views.
4. Added all the Bonus Features too
